# dread-hook

# Upcoming Features
These are features I haven't yet added functionality for but do have the required offsets and capabilities to add:
 - Infinite HP, Missiles, and Power Bombs
 - Simulate if the player has IFrames (intagibility)
 - Simulate if the player has KnockbackFrames (same damage resistances as from IFrames but still takes knockback from hits as normal)
 - Disable Morph Ball Gravity (for funsies)
 - Disable Morph Ball Drag (same level of air and ground control as if you were mid bomb jump, also for funsies)
 - Disable All Forms Of Damage (the same flag is set as with the EMMI Door glitch in v1.0)
 - Adjust Skew angle on the fly
 - Instantly kill the player (if you are stuck or something)
 - Kill the current EMMI, Boss, or visible enemies
 - Gain all items at once (working on making items togglable before adding this. As there is no choice of which items you want/don't want)
 - Set the games framerate (still locked to 60fps)

I also have the offsets for Samus' X and Y velocities for morph and unmorphed states. But I can't think of something cool to use this for.

# Note
This project is a work in progress. Some features look like garbage, some of them have missing functionality.
